# Marketing Campaign Response Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes marketing campaign data from a retail company to understand customer behavior in response to various direct marketing efforts. The dataset contains customer demographics, spending behavior across multiple product categories, and response outcomes to five different campaigns.

## Dataset
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and imported from the marketing_campaign.csv file. [It]("https://github.com/deaanisaaulia/campaign-response-analysis/blob/main/marketing_campaign.csv") covers customer data collected between 2012 and 2014, and the analysis assumes 2015 as the reference year based on the Year_Birth variable.

## Objective
To explore strategic business questions regarding campaign performance, customer segmentation, and purchase behavior, with the goal of improving the effectiveness of future marketing initiatives.

## Business Questions
1.	Which marketing campaign had the highest customer acceptance rate?
2.	What are the demographic differences between customers who responded and those who did not?
3.	Does marital status influence customer response behavior?
4.	Do responders have different spending patterns compared to non-responders?
